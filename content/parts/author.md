**Dodo Denes** Hi there, I'm a Maths student at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. I created this blog 
to formalise my learning journey by summarising the different sources I covered. One essential element 
to make it successful is by receiving feedback.  So if you have any suggestions or you see something that does (not) seem right, let me know!
