title: Manifesto
---

(Under Construction...)

I have a lot of reasons for creating this blog. I think it is useful for me to state some of these as some kind of 
manifesto as well as it is helpful for the reader to get a feel for what they can expect.

### 4 points:

* Summarizing my learning journey about **AI**, **ML** and mostly **Neural Networks**.
* Sharing **code snippets** and **solutions** to exercises related to the material I study.
* Possibly creating introductory material to web design and how to set up your own blog using 
template (featuring `HTML`,`CSS`,`Javascript`, `React` and friends).
* Possibly creating introductory material to programming languages that I 
employ in my solutions such us `Python` and `R`.
