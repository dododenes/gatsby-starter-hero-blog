title: Manifesto
---

(Under Construction...)

I have a lot of reasons for creating this blog. I think it is useful for me to state some of these as some kind of 
manifesto as well as it is helpful for the reader to get a feel for what they can expect.

### Points:

* Summarizing my learning journey about **AI**, **ML** and mostly **Neural Networks**.
* Sharing **code snippets** and **solutions** to exercises related to the material I study.
* Possibly creating **introductory** material to **web design** and how to **set up** your own **blog** using e.g. [HeroBlog](https://github.com/greglobinski/gatsby-starter-hero-blog)
template (featuring `HTML`,`CSS`,`Javascript`, `React` and friends).
* Possibly creating **introductory material to programming** languages that I 
employ in my solutions such as `Python` and `R`.
* The Ubiquitous **Food Posts**.
